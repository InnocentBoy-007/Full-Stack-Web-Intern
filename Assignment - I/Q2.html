    <!-- The href attribute in the <a> tag specifies the URL of the linked page.
        
        The rel attribute is used to specify the relationship between the current document and the linked document.

        By adding the rel="nofollow" attribute to the link, the website owner can prevent search engines from following the link and passing any page rank to the linked page. This can help to maintain the quality and relevance of the website's search engine rankings. This can be useful for links to external sites that are not under the control of the current site, or for links to pages that are not relevant to the current page's content.
